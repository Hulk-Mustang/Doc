      <p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on earth and have distinctly
        massive bodies, large ears, and long trunks. They use their trunks to pick up objects,
        trumpet warnings, greet other elephants, or suck up water for drinking or bathing, among
        other uses. Both male and female African elephants grow tusks and each individual can either
        be left- or right-tusked, and the one they use more is usually smaller because of wear and tear. Elephant tusks
        serve many purposes. These extended teeth can be used to protect the elephant's trunk, lift and move objects,
        gather food, and strip bark from trees. They can also be used for defense. During times of drought, elephants
        even use their tusks to dig holes to find water underground.

      <p>Two genetically different African species exist: the savanna elephant and the forest elephant, with a number of
        characteristics that differentiate them both. The African savanna elephant is the largest elephant species,
        while the Asian forest elephant and the African forest elephant are of a comparable, smaller size.

        Asian elephants differ in several ways from their African relatives, with more than 10 distinct physical
        differences between them. For example, Asian elephants' ears are smaller compared to the large fan-shaped ears
        of the African species. Only some male Asian elephants have tusks, while both male and female African elephants
        grow tusks.

        Led by a matriarch, elephants are organized into complex social structures of females and calves, while male
        elephants tend to live in isolation or in small bachelor groups. A single calf is born to a female once every
        four to five years and after a gestation period of 22 months—the longest of any mammal. Calves are cared for by
        the entire herd of related females. Female calves may stay with their maternal herd for the rest of their lives,
        while males leave the herd as they reach puberty. Forest elephants' social groups differ slightly and may be
        comprised of only an adult female and her offspring. However, they may congregate in larger groups in forest
        clearings where resources are more abundant.

        Elephants need extensive land areas to survive and meet their ecological needs, which includes food, water, and
        space. On average, an elephant can feed up to 18 hours and consume hundreds of pounds of plant matter in a
        single day. As a result, as they lose habitat, they often come into conflict with people in competition for
        resources.

<div class="jkh">Trunk</div>
<div class="css"><p>There are about 40,000 individual muscles in an elephant's 
  trunk. With the help of a trunk, elephants sniff and feel objects, drink water, take food
   and perform various and very precise manipulations (for example, they can pick up a match from 
   the surface of the earth), that is, they use the trunk as an additional limb.The trunk has a truly 
   incredible power. Internally, it consists entirely of muscles, which is why the physical properties of 
   this part of the body are impressive. So, the speed of absorption of water by elephants reaches 300 kilometers 
   per hour.</p></div>

   <div class="jkh">Brain</div>
   <div class="css"><p>It is believed that elephants are equal to dolphins in their ability to find 
    a way out of complex, difficult situations. Elephants also have a large and complex hippocampus 
    that is much larger than that of humans. The elephant hippocampus occupies 0.7% of the central 
    structure of the brain.The mass of the brain of an elephant is just over 5 kg. The elephant's brain contains a total of 300 billion neurons.
     Elephants (both Asian and African) have a very large neocortex, second only to humans, chimpanzees, and dolphins in structural complexity.
      Asian elephants have the largest volume of the cerebral cortex, which is responsible for cognitive abilities, among all existing land animals. On 
      the Discovery Channel, elephants were shown passing an IQ test: their IQ reached 20. According to some reports, the average IQ of elephants corresponds to the average
       IQ of a seven-year-old child. According to research, in terms of the ability to create tools, elephants are at the level of the hominin family.</p></div>

       <div class="jkh">Ears</div>
      <div class="css"><p>Elephants need very, very large ears - the bigger the better - to keep out the heat. 
        Elephants live in hot countries, and they can save themselves from overheating in the sun in two ways: pour water 
        from their trunks or use their ears. No, they do not use them as a fan - although from the outside it seems that this 
        is exactly the case. Elephants don't fan their ears—they wiggle them to cool the ears themselves. Why? An elephant's ears contain capillaries,
         tubes of blood that travel throughout the elephant's body. In the thin elephant ears, when moving, the blood cools and runs back 
         into the body of the elephant, not so hot. Well, elephants also drive away flies with their ears.</p></div>
